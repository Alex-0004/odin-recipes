    Ginger Beef is believed to have originated Calgary, Canada in the 1970s by George Wong. Chef Wong's daughter explains her dad was trying to create a fusion of western and Chinese cuisine by deep frying thinly sliced beef strips instead of stir frying them and then tossing them in the stir fry sauce.

    The ingredients of ginger beef can depend on where it is featured, but the Albertan version generally consists of deep fried strips of beef coated in a dark sweet sauce that is reminiscent of other Asian sauces based on vinegar and sugar
